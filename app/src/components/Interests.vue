        Beyond my professional pursuits, I love staying active and this takes the form of bouldering, going to the gym and hiking. When it is time to unwind, I find myself either reading books (currently reading ...) or enjoying a game of pool. More recently, my love for music has led me to explore the timeless charm of record players and vinyls.
